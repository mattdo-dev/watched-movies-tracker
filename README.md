## Watched Movies Tracker

Written for .NET with C#, with Redis and Postgres support; also Dockerized.

This is a work-in-progress bot that tracks the watched movies listed in a public Google Sheets table in which 
queries can be made as to when a movie, if watched, was last seen and tracks the difference.

Queries made and sent through Twitch API, local long-term storage via Postgres.
